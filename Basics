#We will use # for single line comments
''' we will use 3 single quotes or 3 double quotes for 
multi line comment'''
""" 3 double quotes have a special meaning in function or class defination.
this comment will be treated like a xml comment(in C#) 
Multi-line comments are typically used to add descriptive help at the start of a script, but also work to embed comment text within a command.
Ex: def sum(x,y):
        """ this is a Method1 which defines
        sum of x, y"""
        return x+y

then while we try to access the method that message will be shown to us
"""
''' One more use of 3 double quotes is what ever we write with in the 3 double quotes that will be printed as it is.
ex: myString="""This is the string \n treated as it is "C://ram/laxman" """
print(mystring)
This is the string \n treated as it is "C://ram/laxman"
